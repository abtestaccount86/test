          <h2>Our Purpose:</h2>
          <p>Strategic Sourcing plays a crucial role in managing procurement activities, specifically focusing on Not For Resale (NFR) spend. 
            This encompasses all expenditures related to goods and services that are not intended for resale but are essential for operations. 
            Key focus areas include managing NFR spend, executing strategic projects, and driving cost savings.</p>

        <section id="nfrspend">
          <h2>NFR Spend Management:</h2>
          <p>Sourcing manages $2 Billion in annual NFR spend, with a focus in categories like office supplies, site services, IT services, parts & consumables, utilities, and more. 
            We ensure C&S obtains high-quality goods and services at competitive prices through robust RFX processes and forward/reverse auctions. 
            We work cross-functionally to identify opportunities in cost/savings, contract management, and process improvements.</p>

        <section id="projects">
          <h2>Projects:</h2>
          <p>Strategic sourcing is deeply involved in project-based procurement. This involves collaborating with internal stakeholders to understand their 
            specific needs and identifying the best suppliers to fulfill these requirements. The team manages the end-to-end procurement process for various 
            projects, ensuring timely delivery, cost efficiency, and adherence to quality standards. This includes negotiating contracts, managing supplier 
            relationships, and overseeing project timelines to ensure successful execution.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="savings">
          <h2>Savings:</h2>
          <p>Achieving cost savings is a fundamental objective of the strategic sourcing department. The team employs various strategies to drive savings, 
            such as consolidating supplier bases, leveraging bulk purchasing, and negotiating favorable terms and conditions. 
            By continuously analyzing spend data and market trends, the department identifies opportunities to reduce costs and enhance value. 
            These savings contribute directly to the companyâ€™s financial performance, allowing for reinvestment in other strategic initiatives and improving overall profitability.</p>
